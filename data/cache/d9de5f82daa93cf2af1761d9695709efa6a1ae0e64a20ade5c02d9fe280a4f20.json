{"expires": 1766434280, "value": "{\"cagr_1y\": 8.5, \"cagr_2y\": 9.2, \"cagr_5y\": 10.1, \"cagr_10y\": 9.5, \"reasoning\": \"Based on the provided financial data, considering the sector, beta, and ROE, a conservative estimate is made. The bank's ROE is around 9.87%, which is a good indicator of its profitability. However, the lack of ROIC data and the beta of 1.304, indicating higher volatility, lead to a cautious prediction. The forward P/E being equal to the current P/E suggests stable growth expectations. Thus, the predicted CAGRs are slightly above the average market return, reflecting the bank's financial health and sector stability.\"}"}
