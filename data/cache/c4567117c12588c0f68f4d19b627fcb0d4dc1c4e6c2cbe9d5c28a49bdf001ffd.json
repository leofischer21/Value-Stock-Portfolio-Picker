{"expires": 1766442990, "value": "{\"moat_score\": 0.6, \"reasoning\": \"TRV stock has a moderate competitive moat due to its stable financials, including a reasonable P/E ratio and decent operating margin. However, the debt-to-equity ratio is relatively high, and the ROE, while positive, is not exceptionally high. The company's position in the financial services sector also subjects it to significant competition and regulatory oversight, preventing a higher moat score.\"}"}
