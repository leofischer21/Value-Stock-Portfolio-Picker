{"expires": 1766443127, "value": "{\"moat_score\": 0.8, \"reasoning\": \"DEO's high gross margin and operating margin indicate strong pricing power and efficient operations, while its high ROE suggests ability to generate profits. However, the extremely high debt/equity ratio is a concern. As a consumer defensive stock, DEO likely benefits from stable demand and brand loyalty, contributing to its moat. Overall, a score of 0.8 reflects a strong competitive advantage, albeit with some financial leverage risk.\"}"}
