{"expires": 1766434493, "value": "{\"moat_score\": 0.6, \"reasoning\": \"HSBC's operating margin and ROE indicate a moderate level of profitability, but the lack of gross margin data and unknown debt/equity ratio limit a full assessment. As a well-established bank in the financial services sector, HSBC likely benefits from brand recognition, scale, and a large customer base, contributing to its moat. However, the absence of key data points prevents a higher moat score.\"}"}
