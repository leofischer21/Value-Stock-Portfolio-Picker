The industrials sector tends to be cyclical, and with a beta of 1.671, URI stock is more volatile than the market. The ROE of 0.28781 or 28.78% is a positive indicator. Given these factors, the predicted CAGRs are set, assuming some growth in the short term due to potential market recovery and a more modest long-term growth rate due to sector cyclicality and market volatility.\"}"}
