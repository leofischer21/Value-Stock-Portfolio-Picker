{"expires": 1766443029, "value": "{\"moat_score\": 0.2, \"reasoning\": \"NWG stock has a low P/E ratio and no gross margin, indicating potential undervaluation but also a lack of pricing power. The operating margin is moderate, and ROE is relatively low. The absence of debt/equity data and the financial services sector's competitive nature contribute to a weak moat assessment.\"}"}
