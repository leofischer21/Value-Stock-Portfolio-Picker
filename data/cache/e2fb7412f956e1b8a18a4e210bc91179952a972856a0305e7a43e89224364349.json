{"expires": 1766434379, "value": "{\"moat_score\": 0.7, \"reasoning\": \"AstraZeneca (AZN) has a strong competitive moat due to its high gross margin (83.26%) and moderate operating margin (24.11%), indicating efficient operations and pricing power. Its ROE (21.67%) is also respectable, suggesting the company can generate profits from shareholder equity. However, the high debt/equity ratio (71.05) is a concern. As a healthcare company, AZN benefits from patent protection and regulatory barriers, further strengthening its moat.\"}"}
