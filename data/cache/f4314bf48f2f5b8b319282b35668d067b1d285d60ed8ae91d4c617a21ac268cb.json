{"expires": 1766435142, "value": "```\n{\n  \"quality_score\": 0.6,\n  \"reasoning\": \"CB stock has a moderate quality score due to its decent profit margins and reasonable operating margin. However, the absence of ROIC data and a high debt-to-equity ratio are concerns. The gross margin is relatively low compared to other sectors, but the company's position in the Financial Services sector may justify this. Overall, the stock's quality is average, warranting a score of 0.6.\"\n}\n```"}
