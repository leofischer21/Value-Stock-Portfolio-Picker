The ROE of 12.07% suggests a relatively stable earnings growth potential. However, the lack of ROIC data and the beta of 1.481 indicating higher volatility, lead to a cautious approach in predicting long-term growth. The predicted CAGRs are thus moderate, reflecting a balance between growth potential and risk.\"}"}
