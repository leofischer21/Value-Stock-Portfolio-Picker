The ROE of 12.74% suggests a relatively stable company, but without ROIC, we rely on other metrics. The forward P/E indicates potential undervaluation, which could lead to moderate growth. Given the Technology sector's volatility and the company's beta, returns are tempered. These estimates reflect a balance between potential for growth and the risks associated with the Technology sector.\"}"}
