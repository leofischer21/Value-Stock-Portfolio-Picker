The Consumer Defensive sector tends to be stable, and the low beta suggests lower volatility. The significant difference between current and forward P/E may indicate an undervaluation, potentially leading to higher returns in the short term. However, the lack of ROIC data and the relatively high current P/E compared to the forward P/E suggest a conservative approach to long-term predictions.\"}"}
