The ROE of 33.93% suggests strong profitability, but without ROIC, we rely on other metrics. The forward P/E is slightly lower than the current, indicating potential for growth. Given the beta of 1.147, the stock is slightly more volatile than the market. These factors contribute to the predicted CAGRs, with a moderate increase over the short term and a more stable long-term projection.\"}"}
