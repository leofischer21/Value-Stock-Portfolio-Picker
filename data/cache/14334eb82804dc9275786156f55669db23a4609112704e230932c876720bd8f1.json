The relatively high current P/E ratio may indicate a potential correction, while the lower forward P/E suggests expectations of improved earnings. The ROE is moderate, and the absence of ROIC data limits further insight. Given these factors and the general market conditions, the predicted CAGRs are set with a cautious approach, reflecting potential for growth in the healthcare sector but also considering the volatility and risk associated with the stock market.\"}"}
