{"expires": 1766434556, "value": "{\"moat_score\": 0.8, \"reasoning\": \"NVO stock has a strong competitive moat due to its high gross margin (83%) and operating margin (44%), indicating pricing power and efficient operations. Its ROE (71%) is also above average, suggesting a strong ability to generate profits. However, the high debt/equity ratio (59.57) is a concern. As a healthcare company, NVO likely benefits from regulatory barriers and patent protection, further strengthening its moat.\"}"}
