However, the sector is Technology, which tends to have higher valuations. The ROE is moderate, and margins are relatively stable. Given the beta is slightly above 1, the stock is expected to be slightly more volatile than the market. The predicted CAGRs are conservative, taking into account the potential for growth in the Technology sector, while also considering the current valuation and moderate profitability metrics.\"}"}
