The Technology sector tends to be volatile, and the high beta of 1.552 amplifies this. The current P/E is higher than the forward P/E, suggesting potential for growth. The ROE of 17.2% indicates decent profitability. However, without ROIC, we rely on gross and operating margins, which are relatively stable. These factors contribute to the predicted CAGRs, with shorter terms being more volatile and longer terms smoothing out risks.\"}"}
