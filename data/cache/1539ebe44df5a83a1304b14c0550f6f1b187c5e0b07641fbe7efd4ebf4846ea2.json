The relatively low beta of 0.334 suggests lower volatility, which is common in the healthcare sector. The return on equity (ROE) of 40.7% is strong, indicating efficient management of shareholder equity. However, without ROIC data, we rely more heavily on P/E ratios and sector averages. Given these factors and considering historical market trends, the predicted CAGRs are conservative estimates, reflecting a moderate growth expectation for GILD stock over different time horizons.\"}"}
