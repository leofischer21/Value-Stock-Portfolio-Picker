The ROE of 11.798% suggests a relatively stable return, while the beta of 0.872 indicates lower volatility compared to the market. The forward P/E being lower than the current P/E may indicate a potential for growth, but the lack of ROIC data introduces some uncertainty. Given these factors, the predicted CAGRs are set with a moderate growth expectation, taking into account the general performance of the financial services sector.\"}"}
