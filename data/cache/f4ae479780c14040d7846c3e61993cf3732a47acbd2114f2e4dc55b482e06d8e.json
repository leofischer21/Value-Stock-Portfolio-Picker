The current and forward P/E ratios suggest a potential for moderate growth, while the ROE indicates a reasonable return on equity. These factors contribute to the predicted CAGRs, with a slightly higher return expected in the 5-year horizon due to potential long-term growth in the healthcare sector.\"}"}
