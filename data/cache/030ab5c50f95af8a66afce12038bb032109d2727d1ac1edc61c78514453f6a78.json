{"expires": 1766442690, "value": "{\"moat_score\": 0.8, \"reasoning\": \"WM stock has a high P/E ratio and decent operating margin, indicating a strong market position. The high debt/equity ratio is a concern, but the company's ability to maintain a high ROE suggests effective management of its debt. The industrials sector can be competitive, but WM's gross margin and operating margin suggest a competitive advantage, warranting a strong moat score.\"}"}
