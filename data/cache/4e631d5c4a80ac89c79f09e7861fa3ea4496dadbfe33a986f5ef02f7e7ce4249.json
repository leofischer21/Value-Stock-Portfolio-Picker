The relatively low forward P/E and decent ROE suggest potential for moderate growth, while the beta indicates lower volatility. Margins are considered in the context of the energy sector. These factors contribute to the predicted CAGRs, with a slight increase in the short term due to potential sector rotation and a decrease in the long term as growth stabilizes.\"}"}
