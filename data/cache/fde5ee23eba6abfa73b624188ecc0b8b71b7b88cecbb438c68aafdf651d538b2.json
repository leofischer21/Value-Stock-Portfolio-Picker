{"expires": 1766434274, "value": "{\"moat_score\": 0.6, \"reasoning\": \"BAC's operating margin is relatively high, indicating efficient operations, and its ROE suggests some level of profitability. However, the lack of gross margin data and unclear debt/equity ratio introduce uncertainty. As a well-established bank in the Financial Services sector, BAC likely benefits from scale and brand recognition, but these advantages are not unique and can be replicated by competitors, thus not warranting an exceptional moat score.\"}"}
