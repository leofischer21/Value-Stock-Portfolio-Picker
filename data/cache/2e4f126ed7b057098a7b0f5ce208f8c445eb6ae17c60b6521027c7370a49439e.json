{"expires": 1766435174, "value": "{\"moat_score\": 0.6, \"reasoning\": \"HCA's competitive moat is driven by its strong position in the healthcare sector, with a relatively high gross margin and operating margin. However, the lack of data on ROE and debt/equity ratio limits a full assessment of its financial health and leverage. The P/E ratio is somewhat elevated, which may indicate a premium for its market position, but without more data, the moat score is capped at 0.6, indicating a respectable but not exceptional competitive advantage.\"}"}
