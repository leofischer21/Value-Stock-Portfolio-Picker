The current and forward P/E ratios suggest a relatively high valuation, which may impact short-term returns. The ROE indicates a moderate level of profitability. Given these factors, the predicted returns are modest, with longer-term horizons offering slightly higher growth potential due to the company's ability to adapt and potentially improve profitability over time.\"}"}
