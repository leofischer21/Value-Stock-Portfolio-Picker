{"expires": 1766442906, "value": "{\"cagr_1y\": 8.5, \"cagr_2y\": 9.2, \"cagr_5y\": 10.1, \"cagr_10y\": 9.5, \"reasoning\": \"Based on the provided financial data, considering the sector, beta, and current/forward P/E ratios, a conservative estimate is made. The ROE of 12.15% suggests a relatively stable earnings growth potential. However, without ROIC and with a beta slightly above 1, indicating higher volatility than the market average, the predictions are tempered. The operating margin of 37.402% is a positive indicator but is balanced against the lack of gross margin data and the overall market conditions. These factors contribute to a modest growth prediction, especially over shorter time horizons.\"}"}
