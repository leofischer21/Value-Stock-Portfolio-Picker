The Technology sector tends to be volatile, and with a beta of 1.26, TSM is slightly more volatile than the market. The current and forward P/E suggest a premium valuation, which might impact short-term growth. The ROE indicates decent profitability. Given these factors, the predicted CAGRs are set with a bias towards moderate growth, acknowledging potential fluctuations in the Technology sector.\"}"}
