The Consumer Cyclical sector can be volatile, but TJX's relatively low beta suggests some stability. The return on equity (ROE) is moderate, supporting a reasonable growth expectation. Given these factors, the predicted CAGRs are set, assuming a gradual increase in growth potential over the short term due to market recovery and a more stable, moderate growth in the long term.\"}"}
