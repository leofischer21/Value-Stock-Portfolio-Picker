{"expires": 1766442634, "value": "{\"moat_score\": 0.6, \"reasoning\": \"GD stock has a moderate competitive moat, driven by its decent operating margin and return on equity (ROE), indicating some level of pricing power and efficiency. However, the debt-to-equity ratio is relatively high, which may limit its financial flexibility and weigh on its moat. The gross margin is also relatively low, suggesting some vulnerability to cost pressures. Overall, while GD has some advantages, they are not exceptionally strong, warranting a moat score of 0.6.\"}"}
