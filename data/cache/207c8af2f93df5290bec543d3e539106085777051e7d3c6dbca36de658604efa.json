The current P/E is relatively high, which might indicate a potential correction, while the forward P/E suggests some growth expectations. The ROE is around 59.9%, indicating a healthy return on equity. Given these factors and the beta slightly above 1, suggesting more volatility than the market average, the predicted returns are cautiously optimistic, reflecting potential for growth in the Basic Materials sector while accounting for market and company-specific risks.\"}"}
