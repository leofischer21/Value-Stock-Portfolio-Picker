{"expires": 1766442937, "value": "{\"cagr_1y\": 8.5, \"cagr_2y\": 9.2, \"cagr_5y\": 10.5, \"cagr_10y\": 11.8, \"reasoning\": \"Based on the provided financial data, considering the relatively low beta and the sector being healthcare, which tends to be less volatile, the predicted returns are conservative. The current and forward P/E ratios suggest a reasonable valuation, while the ROE indicates a moderate level of profitability. The absence of ROIC data does not significantly impact this prediction due to the availability of other key metrics. The margins, especially the operating margin, are on the lower side, which might affect long-term growth potential. Therefore, the predicted CAGRs reflect a cautious approach, considering both the potential for growth and the risks associated with the healthcare sector and the company's financials.\"}"}
