The Consumer Defensive sector tends to be stable, and the beta close to 1 suggests average market volatility. The P/E ratios indicate a premium valuation, which might impact short-term growth. The ROE is relatively high, indicating good profitability. However, without ROIC, we rely on gross and operating margins, which are positive but not exceptionally high. These factors lead to a moderate growth prediction, with a slight increase over longer horizons due to the defensive nature of the sector and potential for stable, long-term growth.\"}"}
