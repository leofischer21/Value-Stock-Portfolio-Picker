{"expires": 1766442955, "value": "{\"cagr_1y\": 10.2, \"cagr_2y\": 12.1, \"cagr_5y\": 15.1, \"cagr_10y\": 12.5, \"reasoning\": \"Based on the provided financial data, considering the sector, beta, and profitability metrics like ROE and margins, a conservative estimate is made. The Consumer Cyclical sector can be volatile, and the beta of 1.112 suggests slightly higher market risk. The ROE of 30.78% indicates strong profitability, but without ROIC, we rely on other metrics. The forward P/E suggests a potential for growth, but the current P/E is relatively high. These factors lead to a moderate growth prediction, with higher returns expected in the mid-term due to potential sector growth and the company's strong profitability, but tempered by the high valuation and market risk.\"}"}
