{"expires": 1766442872, "value": "{\"cagr_1y\": 8.5, \"cagr_2y\": 9.2, \"cagr_5y\": 10.1, \"cagr_10y\": 8.8, \"reasoning\": \"Based on the provided financial data, considering the sector, beta, and valuation multiples, a conservative estimate is made. The Basic Materials sector tends to be cyclical, and the beta of 1.08 suggests slightly higher volatility than the market. The current and forward P/E ratios are relatively high, which might indicate a premium valuation. The ROE of 39.29% is strong, but without ROIC, we rely on gross and operating margins for profitability, which are around 59.57% and 52.37%, respectively. These margins are healthy but may fluctuate with commodity prices. Given these factors, the predicted CAGRs are conservative, reflecting potential for growth but also considering the cyclical nature of the sector and potential valuation adjustments.\"}"}
