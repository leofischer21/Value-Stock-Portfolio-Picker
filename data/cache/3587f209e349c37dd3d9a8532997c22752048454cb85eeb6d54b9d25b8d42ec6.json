{"expires": 1766434729, "value": "{\"moat_score\": 0.4, \"reasoning\": \"MUFG's operating margin is relatively low, and the absence of debt/equity data makes it difficult to assess its financial leverage. The ROE is also relatively low, indicating a potentially weak competitive moat. However, as a large financial institution, MUFG may still have some advantages due to its scale and brand recognition, warranting a score slightly above weak/no moat.\"}"}
