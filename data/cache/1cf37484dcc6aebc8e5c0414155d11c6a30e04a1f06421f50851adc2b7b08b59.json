{"expires": 1766435078, "value": "{\"moat_score\": 0.6, \"reasoning\": \"BUD's moat is driven by its strong brand portfolio and significant market share in the consumer defensive sector. Although the debt-to-equity ratio is high, the company's gross and operating margins are relatively stable, indicating some level of competitive advantage. However, the lack of ROE data and relatively high P/E ratio prevent a higher moat score.\"}"}
