{"expires": 1766443100, "value": "{\"moat_score\": 0.6, \"reasoning\": \"PCAR's moderate P/E ratio, decent gross and operating margins, and reasonable ROE indicate a stable financial position. However, the high debt/equity ratio is a concern. As a leading manufacturer in the Industrials sector, PCAR likely benefits from brand recognition, distribution networks, and some barriers to entry, but the debt levels and lack of extremely high margins or returns limit the moat score to average.\"}"}
