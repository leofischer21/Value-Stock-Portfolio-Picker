The current and forward P/E ratios suggest a fairly valued stock, while the ROE indicates a decent return on equity. The lack of ROIC data does not significantly impact the prediction due to the availability of other key metrics. The predicted CAGRs reflect a moderate growth expectation, taking into account the sector's characteristics and the company's financial health.\"}"}
