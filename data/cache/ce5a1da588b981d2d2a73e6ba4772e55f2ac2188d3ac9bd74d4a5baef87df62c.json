However, the company's debt-to-equity ratio is relatively high, which may limit its financial flexibility and weigh on its moat. Additionally, the healthcare sector is subject to intense competition and regulatory pressures, which may also impact PFE's moat. Overall, PFE's moat is above average but not exceptional.\"}"}
