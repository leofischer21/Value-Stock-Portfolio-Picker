The lower beta suggests lower volatility, and the healthcare sector tends to be less cyclical. The forward P/E indicates potential undervaluation, which could lead to moderate growth. However, the lack of ROIC data introduces some uncertainty. These predictions are conservative, reflecting the overall market conditions and the company's financial health.\"}"}
