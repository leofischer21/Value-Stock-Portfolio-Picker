The low beta suggests lower volatility, and the sector is generally stable. The current and forward P/E ratios indicate a potential for moderate growth. The ROE is relatively high, indicating efficient operations. However, without ROIC, we rely on other metrics for our estimate. Given these factors, the predicted CAGRs are moderate, reflecting a stable growth expectation for DEO stock.\"}"}
