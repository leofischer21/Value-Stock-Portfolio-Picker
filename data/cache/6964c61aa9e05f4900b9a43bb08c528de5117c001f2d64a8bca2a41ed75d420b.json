However, considering its sector (Healthcare) and relatively stable margins, a moderate growth is expected. The negative beta suggests a lower volatility compared to the market, which may contribute to more stable returns. The lack of ROE and ROIC data limits the precision of the estimate, leading to a conservative prediction.\"}"}
