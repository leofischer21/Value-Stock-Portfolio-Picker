{"expires": 1766442234, "value": "{\"moat_score\": 0.6, \"reasoning\": \"SCCO stock has a moderate competitive moat due to its high gross and operating margins, indicating pricing power and efficient operations. However, the debt-to-equity ratio is high, which may limit its ability to invest in growth opportunities and withstand economic downturns. The ROE is also relatively low, suggesting that the company may not be generating strong returns on shareholder capital. Overall, the moat is average, driven by operational efficiency but constrained by financial leverage.\"}"}
