The low beta suggests lower volatility, and the current and forward P/E ratios indicate a relatively undervalued stock. The ROE is moderate, supporting a stable return. Given these factors, the predicted CAGRs are conservative and reflect a gradual increase in expected returns over longer time horizons.\"}"}
