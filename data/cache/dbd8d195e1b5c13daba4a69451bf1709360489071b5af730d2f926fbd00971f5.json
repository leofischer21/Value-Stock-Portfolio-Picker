The current and forward P/E ratios suggest a relatively stable valuation. The ROE indicates decent profitability. Given the beta of 1.217, slightly above average volatility is expected. These factors contribute to the predicted CAGRs, with a moderate increase over the short term due to potential market fluctuations and a more stable long-term outlook.\"}"}
