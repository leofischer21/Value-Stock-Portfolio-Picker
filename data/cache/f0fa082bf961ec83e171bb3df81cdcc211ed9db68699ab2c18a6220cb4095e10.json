The Industrials sector tends to be less volatile, and the beta of 1.116 suggests a slightly above-average risk profile. The ROE of 22.767% indicates a healthy return on equity, supporting the predicted returns. However, the lack of ROIC data and the reliance on other metrics may introduce some uncertainty.\"}"}
