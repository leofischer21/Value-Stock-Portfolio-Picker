{"expires": 1766442972, "value": "{\"moat_score\": 0.2, \"reasoning\": \"MRVL stock has a weak competitive moat due to its negative P/E ratio, low operating margin, and negative ROE, indicating poor profitability and potential financial distress. The high debt/equity ratio also raises concerns about its financial health. Only the gross margin is relatively stable, but it's not enough to offset the other weaknesses.\"}"}
