The industrials sector tends to be relatively stable, and the beta close to 1 suggests average market volatility. The drop in forward P/E compared to the current P/E may indicate expectations of improved earnings, supporting higher returns in the short term. However, long-term returns are tempered by the overall market conditions and the stability of the sector, leading to a slightly lower estimated CAGR over 10 years.\"}"}
