{"expires": 1766434738, "value": "{\"moat_score\": 0.7, \"reasoning\": \"SONY's competitive moat is driven by its strong brand recognition, diversified product portfolio, and significant investments in research and development. The gross margin and operating margin indicate a moderate level of pricing power and operational efficiency. However, the debt-to-equity ratio is relatively high, which may pose a risk to the company's financial stability. Overall, SONY's moat is above average due to its brand and product strengths, but is not exceptional due to financial leverage concerns.\"}"}
