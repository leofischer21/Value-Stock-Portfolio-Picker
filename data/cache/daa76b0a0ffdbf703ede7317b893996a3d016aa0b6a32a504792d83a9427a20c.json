The Consumer Cyclical sector can be volatile, and with a beta of 1.906, RCL stock is expected to be more volatile than the market. The current and forward P/E ratios suggest a fairly valued stock. The ROE of 0.46677 or 46.677% indicates good profitability. However, without ROIC, we rely on gross and operating margins for efficiency, which are moderate. These factors contribute to the predicted CAGRs, with shorter terms being slightly more conservative due to market volatility and longer terms reflecting more stable growth trends.\"}"}
