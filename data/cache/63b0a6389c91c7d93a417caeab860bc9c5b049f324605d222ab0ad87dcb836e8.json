{"expires": 1766442775, "value": "{\"quality_score\": 0.7, \"reasoning\": \"CDNS stock has a high gross margin and operating margin, indicating strong profitability. However, the debt-to-equity ratio is high, which may pose a risk. The ROE is moderate, but the lack of ROIC data is a limitation. Overall, the stock's quality is above average due to its strong margins, but the high debt level prevents it from being exceptional.\"}"}
