{"expires": 1766443126, "value": "{\"cagr_1y\": 8.5, \"cagr_2y\": 10.2, \"cagr_5y\": 12.1, \"cagr_10y\": 9.5, \"reasoning\": \"Given the stock's beta of 1.62, indicating higher volatility than the market, and considering the sector is Technology which can be prone to fluctuations, a conservative approach is taken. The current and forward P/E ratios suggest a potential for growth but also indicate the stock might be slightly overvalued. The lack of ROE and ROIC data limits a deeper analysis of the company's profitability. However, the gross and operating margins are relatively healthy, suggesting some resilience. Therefore, the predicted CAGRs are set with a cautious outlook, reflecting potential for growth but also acknowledging the risks and uncertainties in the technology sector.\"}"}
