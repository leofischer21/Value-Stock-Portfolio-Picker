{"expires": 1766434607, "value": "{\"moat_score\": 0.8, \"reasoning\": \"SHOP stock has a high P/E ratio and gross margin, indicating strong market position and pricing power. Although debt/equity is high, the company's operating margin and ROE suggest efficient operations and ability to generate returns. As a technology sector company, SHOP's moat is likely driven by its brand, network effects, and continuous innovation, but the high debt/equity ratio prevents a perfect score.\"}"}
