The forward P/E suggests a potential correction, while the ROE indicates moderate profitability. Given these factors, a conservative estimate for short-term returns is around 10-12%, increasing to 15% over 5 years due to potential long-term growth in the technology sector, and then stabilizing around 12.5% over 10 years as volatility and growth prospects balance out.\"}"}
