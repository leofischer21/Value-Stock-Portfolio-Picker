The Consumer Cyclical sector can be volatile, but GM's current P/E and forward P/E suggest potential for growth. The beta of 1.311 indicates higher volatility than the market average, which is factored into the estimates. The return on equity (ROE) of 4.42% is relatively low but still positive, supporting some level of growth. Given these factors, the predicted CAGRs are set with a short-term focus on recovery and long-term focus on stable, albeit slower, growth.\"}"}
