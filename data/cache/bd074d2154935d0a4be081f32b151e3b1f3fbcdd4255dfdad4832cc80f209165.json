The Consumer Cyclical sector can be volatile, but ROST's moderate beta and reasonable valuation (P/E ratios) suggest a relatively stable growth prospect. The return on equity (ROE) is respectable, indicating efficient operations. However, without ROIC and considering the margins, a cautious approach is taken. These estimates reflect a balance between growth potential and the risks associated with the sector and market fluctuations.\"}"}
